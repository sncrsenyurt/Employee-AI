# README

## Project Overview
This project's aim is to measure, enhance, and interpret the synchronization and efficiency among multiple employees working together on the same tasks at the same times. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, the project seeks to optimize team performance, providing valuable insights into collaborative dynamics and ensuring that task assignments are data-driven and efficiency-focused.

## Notebooks

### 1. `fake_data.ipynb`

**Purpose:** 
This notebook is designed to generate an initial dataset from an almost empty CSV file by adding necessary rows and columns. It creates synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Import Libraries:** 
   - Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `random` are imported to handle data manipulation and random data generation.

2. **Load CSV File:** 
   - The initial, almost empty CSV file is loaded into a DataFrame.

3. **Generate Data:** 
   - New columns are added to the DataFrame with randomly generated data for various attributes such as `task_id`, `vehicle_type`, `distance`, and `duration`.

4. **Assign Random Names:** 
   - Random names are assigned to various positions such as `driver`, `passenger`, `operator`, and `instructor` from a predefined list.

5. **Add Additional Columns:** 
   - Columns for tracking purposes, such as `git_sha` and `git_branch`, are added.

6. **Save Updated CSV:** 
   - The updated DataFrame is saved to a new CSV file, `updated_fake_data.csv`.

**Output:** 
The output of this notebook is `updated_fake_data.csv`, a dataset filled with synthetic data ready for further processing.

### 2. `scores.ipynb`

**Purpose:** 
This notebook processes the employee performance data and generates scores. It divides employees into five equal groups based on their scores and visualizes the performance metrics.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Import Libraries:** 
   - Necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, are imported.

2. **Load Data:** 
   - The updated dataset from `fake_data.ipynb` is loaded.

3. **Calculate Scores:** 
   - Scores are normalized to ensure they fall within a consistent range, and employees are divided into five equal groups based on their scores.

4. **Group Employees:** 
   - Employees are grouped based on their normalized scores to facilitate comparison and analysis.

5. **Visualize Data:** 
   - The distribution of score groups is visualized using a histogram to provide a clear representation of performance metrics.

**Output:** 
The output includes a score table and visualizations that represent the employee performance grouped into five categories.

### 3. `employee_recommendation.ipynb`

**Purpose:** 
This notebook uses the `updated_fake_data.csv` dataset to develop a prediction model using XGBoost. It provides employee recommendations based on user input.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Import Libraries:** 
   - Libraries for data preprocessing and machine learning, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `LabelEncoder`, and `xgboost`, are imported.

2. **Load Data:** 
   - The updated dataset is loaded from the CSV file generated by the previous notebook.

3. **Preprocess Data:** 
   - Data is preprocessed, including label encoding for categorical variables to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

4. **Train Model:** 
   - An XGBoost regression model is trained on the dataset to predict employee suitability for various positions based on specific features.

5. **Implement Recommendation System:** 
   - A function is implemented to recommend employee groups based on user-provided time slots. This function uses the trained model to make predictions and provide the best recommendations.

**Output:** 
The output is a recommendation system that predicts and suggests the best employees for specific tasks based on the input time slots provided by the user.

## How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary libraries using the command:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
     ```

2. **Generate Fake Data:**
   - Run the `fake_data.ipynb` notebook to generate the `updated_fake_data.csv` dataset. This dataset will contain the synthetic data needed for further processing.

3. **Process Scores:**
   - Run the `scores.ipynb` notebook to process the scores and visualize the performance metrics. This will create a score table and visualizations to help understand employee performance.

4. **Employee Recommendation:**
   - Run the `employee_recommendation.ipynb` notebook to train the prediction model and get employee recommendations based on user input. This will provide recommendations for the best employees for specific tasks.
